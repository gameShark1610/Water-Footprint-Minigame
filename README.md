# 🌎 Water Footprint Minigame

**Author:** Yair
**Version:** 1.0

## 🎮 Description

This is a Java **minigame built with Swing** that calculates and raises awareness about your **water footprint**.

* You control a small Earth sprite at the bottom of the screen.
* Objects (food, showers, pools, etc.) fall from the top.
* You must catch them before time runs out.
* Each object represents a **different water consumption value (liters)**.
* At the end of the game, your **total water footprint** is calculated and displayed.

The game uses **Java Swing**, `Timer` events, and image rendering for animation.

## 📂 Files

* `Dibujo.java` → Main game panel with logic, drawing, and controls.
* `/imagenes/` → Folder with sprites (`tierra.png`, `alimentos.png`, `piscina.png`, etc.).
* `*.exe` (optional) → Generated runnable file (only works if properly exported with Java-to-EXE wrapper).

## ▶️ How to Run

### Option 1: Run with Java

1. Compile the project:

   ```bash
   javac minijuego/*.java
   ```
2. Run the game:

   ```bash
   java minijuego.Dibujo
   ```

### Option 2: Run with an `.exe`

If you already have the `.exe` file (for Windows):

* Just double-click `minijuego.exe` (or `procesos.exe`) to launch the game.
  ⚠️ Note: `.exe` is not generated by default in Java. You need tools like **Launch4j**, **JSmooth**, or **jpackage** to convert your `.jar` into `.exe`.

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add sound effects and background music.
* Improve collision detection.
* Add levels and difficulty scaling.
* Export a stable `.jar` and `.exe` with assets included.
